# Decentralized Banking Application

Welcome to my dbank project, a decentralized banking application built on the Internet Computer platform. This project aims to provide secure and efficient banking solutions, leveraging blockchain technology to enable seamless transactions and user management. As I embark on this development journey, I am excited to explore the capabilities of the Internet Computer and Motoko programming language while creating a robust application that prioritizes user privacy and decentralization.

## Getting Started

### Explore the Project Directory

To get started, I might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in my development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

### Useful Documentation

To learn more before I start working with dbank, I can refer to the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](#)
- [SDK Developer Tools](#)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](#)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](#)
- [JavaScript API Reference](#)

### Initial Commands

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

``` cd dbank/ ```
```dfx help```
```dfx config --help ```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
